# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

# Do keep checking for dependencies running into security vulnerabilities. That is one of the primary problems with Ruby.

Things you may want to check before running the application:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions


# Git clone the application

# Do a bundle install to install all the dependencies.

# "rails server" to start the server and access the app at localhost:3000.

Below is a screenshot of the homepage of the application.
